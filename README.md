# Să scriem corect

The project was build for the Open phase of the Romanian National Contest Infoeducație 2016 (infoeudcatie.ro), following the [vicisok113](https://github.com/vicisok113)'s qualification on the first 5 positions in the main phase of the contest. We had 24 hours to make a project called "Learn to type correctly" intended for use of Primary School pupils.

And [artur99](https://github.com/artur99) has been taken as a team collaborator.
